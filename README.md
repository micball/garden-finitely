# Garden-Finitely
## Overview
**Garden-Finitely** Is a project with a goal of putting together a full suite of applications for use by gardeners and farmers.
The applications are designed to be simple and intuitive enough that a casual gardener can use the apps, but powerful enough that a full scale farm or intensive market-style grower has the opportunity to leverage effective data to guide decisions on their farm.

## Information about Individual Applications
### Garden Calendar Generator CLI
The Garden Calendar Generator CLI is a basic CLI tool build using Python that allows a user to generate a text based calendar for when they should be planting crops for successsion planting throughout a season.
It takes into account the frost dates, and user input data regarding how often they wish to plant their crop.
Based off of this data, it generates a calendar with planting and harvesting dates so that a grower can optimize yields across the entire season.
### Garden Calendar Generator App
Currently in the works, the Garden Calendar Generator is a mobile or desktop based application that builds on the CLI tool by implementing a GUI, and enabling more intuitive crop managing and profile control.
Once complete, the Garden-Finity Calendar will allow users to opt into notifications, manage crop profiles, opt in or out of specific plantings, and generate a digital or physical calendar.  
The second edition is planned to include crop profiles on the top 100 crops for home growers.
### Garden Planner
A mobile and desktop application that allows users to layout and organize their crops.  
Users will be able to set custom spacing profiles for plants, ranging from individual plants, to row-feet, to acres.
### Garden Connect
There is a significant group of people who want to garden but don't have access to land on which to do so.
Garden-Connect aims to solve that problem by connecting land-owners with people who want to grow things.
### Nature Capture
Build with the goal of getting people outside more, Nature Capture is a unique offering from Garden-Finitely.  Unlike other apps in our suite, Nature Capture is a game that encourages people to get outside and notice the world around them.  Players will use mobile devices to take photos of specimens (both cultivated and wild) and get points by capturing photos of native and non-native flora.
The app will include a life-list of specimens that players have spotted, and will allow for specific geographic area goals.
While version 1 will launch with players having to identify plants on their own, the goal of version 2 will be to capture and process the images, automatically suggesting plant identification to the player.
Our goal for version 3 (or two, if we can squeeze it in) will include uploading anonymized data to community science databases so that players are not only contributing to their own knowledge of their community, but also to the scientific community at large.
### Garden Automator
We get it, gardening isn't for everyone. Some people want all of the rewards of gardening without to do the work. 
Let's work together to make that possible.
We're aiming to ultimately produce a gardening robot that is affordable for home growers, and that pairs with our suite of apps to make gardening easier than ever for home gardeners and small growers.
